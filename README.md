k-D Tree
This is java code for 2-D Tree. It is a binary tree to find the neighbour points of the line .
class Node is formed which represents a 2-D point and leaf of the binary tree. class Polygon searches if the poit lies inside the polygon formed through nodes. Class KDTree forms and prints
KD Tree and the code finds the points that lies inside the two formed orthogonal polygon.

Segment Tree
In segment tree , leaf nodes are inputs elements of the input array . Each internal node represents some merging of the leaf nodes. The merging may be different for different problems. Merging is sum of leaves under a node.Class SegmentTree insert nodes in segment tree and merge them to find sum , also it can update the elements of the segment tree and find new sum of the elements int the range of given index.
